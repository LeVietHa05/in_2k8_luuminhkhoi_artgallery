      "poem": "About the artist: <br>  Luu Minh Khoi, a senior at Nguyen Sieu High School, was born and raised in Vietnam, where the land, people, and traditions became the wellspring of his inspiration. Guided by principles of the 19th-century Impressionist movement, Khoi’s paintings depict the authentic light, memory, and spirit of his homeland, as he seeks to capture not only what the eyes see but what the heart feels. <br> <br> About this collection: <br>  This collection traces Khoi’s artistic journey from 2023 to 2025. While his techniques have steadily matured over time, the sincerity and reverence at the heart of his works remain unchanged. It is this vision, woven into each brush stroke, that translates the warm and rich living palette of Vietnam into a timeless beauty on the canvas.",

With care in her hands, my mother would place each stem, arranging both beauty and memory. At first, I thought I was only capturing the flowers’ form. But somewhere between the first sketch and the last dab of color, there appeared the light falling gently on the vase, the drifting fragrance of childhood, the quiet love that lives in the heart of our everyday life.",

      "description": "This painting is a tribute to the tireless fishermen of Vietnam. The boat, the faithful companion through countless tides, rests quietly beside the weathered pier, a silent witness to generations of fish, shrimp, and squids that have nourished the village. The late afternoon sun drapes the scene in a warm, golden glow, as the harbor breathes with the rhythm of labor and the resilience of life at sea. In this still moment, I seek to reveal not only the serene beauty of sunset, but the enduring spirit and character of those who call the waves their home.",
